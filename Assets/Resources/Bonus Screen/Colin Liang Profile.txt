Colin is a third-generation Chinese-Canadian. He flunked his first year at university by drinking through it, but changed his ways after getting caught and arrested. Afraid his parents would find out, he stopped drinking scraped together decent enough grades to keep his scholarships. This year, Colin brought back a bunch of Canada shirts, because he 1) was tired of everyone assuming he was from China, and 2) was tired of Jon's California shirts. His family lives in a suburb of Toronto, and he has three sisters. Colin is the Ultimate Club's treasurer.
