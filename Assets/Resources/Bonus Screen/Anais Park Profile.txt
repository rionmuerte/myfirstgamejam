Anais was born in Los Angeles and adopted by Korean-American missionaries. She grew up in Indonesia where her family hosted Ultimate clinics, and has lived in several countries since. At fifteen she developed bursitis in her knees, so she can no longer play Ultimate very well. She has compensated for this by becoming an excellent handler. Anais plans to become a dentist and travel to poor countries to provide dental care. Her family currently lives on the East Coast of the United States. She is head of the Ultimate Club.
