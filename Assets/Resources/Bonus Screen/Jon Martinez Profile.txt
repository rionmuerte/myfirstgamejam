Born and raised in Southern California, Jon calls himself a "Whitexican." Jon grew up in hard circumstances with a very racist mother, but got interested in his Mexican heritage as an adult. He fell in love with the culture and now speaks excellent Mexican Spanish. He works for Public Utilities and is getting through college very slowly, as he racked up a lot of debt from failed classes a decade ago. He is interested microloans and using business as a way to help people. He is interested in working somewhere in South America.
